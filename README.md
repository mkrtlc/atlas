# Atlas
Self-hosted business platform with inter-connected CRM, HRM, digital signatures, document editor, task management, spreadsheets, file storage, and drawing tools, all can be used by the same team. It's a self hosted alternative for [Zoho](https://zoho.com/) and [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/).

Atlas can also deploy several 3rd party apps, including [Activepieces](https://www.activepieces.com/), [Cal.com](http://cal.com/), [Formbricks](http://formbricks.com/), [Mattermost](http://mattermost.com/), [Umami](https://umami.is/) and [Checkmate](https://checkmate.so/).

## Quick start (Docker)

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bluewave-labs/atlas.git
cd atlas
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/bluewave-labs/atlas.git
cd atlas
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File setup.ps1
```

This will:
1. Generate secure secrets automatically
2. Start PostgreSQL, Redis, and Atlas via Docker
3. Wait for the service to be healthy

Then open **http://localhost:3001** and create your admin account.

## Manual Docker setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bluewave-labs/atlas.git
cd atlas
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
```

Open **http://localhost:3001** and create your admin account. Secrets are auto-generated on first run.

To pin a specific version: `IMAGE_TAG=1.7.0 docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d`

## HTTPS with Caddy (optional)

```bash
# 1. Set your domain in .env
echo 'ATLAS_DOMAIN=atlas.yourdomain.com' >> .env

# 2. Point your domain's DNS A record to your server's IP

# 3. Start with HTTPS
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml -f docker-compose.https.yml up -d
```

Caddy automatically obtains and renews Let's Encrypt SSL certificates. Ports 80 and 443 must be open.

## Development setup

```bash
# 1. Start PostgreSQL and Redis
docker compose up -d

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# 3. Create environment file with dev secrets
cp .env.example .env
# Generate secrets (required even for dev):
#   openssl rand -hex 32  → paste into JWT_SECRET
#   openssl rand -hex 32  → paste into JWT_REFRESH_SECRET
#   openssl rand -hex 32  → paste into TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY

# 4. Start dev servers
npm run dev
```

- Client: http://localhost:5180
- Server: http://localhost:3001
- On first visit, you'll be prompted to create an admin account.

## Google integration (optional)

Enables CRM email/calendar sync and Drive file import/export.

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) → **APIs & Services > Credentials**
2. Create an **OAuth 2.0 Client ID** (type: Web application)
3. Set the authorized redirect URI to: `https://your-domain.com/api/v1/auth/google/callback`
4. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret into your `.env`:
   ```
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
   ```
5. Enable these APIs in **APIs & Services > Library**:
   - Gmail API
   - Google Calendar API
   - Google Drive API
6. Users can connect their Google account from **Settings** or when using Google-dependent features

## Troubleshooting

**"network ... not found" error**

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml down
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
```

**Port 3001 already in use**

Stop the process using port 3001, or set a different port in `.env`:
```
PORT=3002
```

**Update to latest version**

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
```

**Reset everything (fresh start)**

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml down -v
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
```

### Not supported

| Platform | Reason |
|----------|--------|

> ```bash
> sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile && sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
> sudo mkswap /swapfile && sudo swapon /swapfile
> echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
> ```
