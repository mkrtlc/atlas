## Identified Gaps — Features Worth Implementing

### Gap 1: Invoicing & Payments
**HoneyBook:** Create branded invoices, send to clients, accept payments (credit card, ACH, bank transfer, Apple Pay, Google Pay). Automated payment reminders. Payment tracking and overdue alerts.

**Atlas today:** `projectInvoices` and `projectInvoiceLineItems` tables exist in schema but this is limited to the Projects app. No standalone invoicing app, no payment gateway integration, no client-facing payment pages.

**Opportunity:** A dedicated **Invoices** app (or enhanced CRM invoicing) that lets teams create invoices linked to CRM deals/contacts, track payment status, send reminders. Payment gateway integration (Stripe) could come later as a marketplace add-on.

**Relevance: 5/5** — Every small company needs invoicing. This is table-stakes for a business platform.

---

### Gap 2: Client Portal (External-Facing Pages)
**HoneyBook:** Clients get their own login/portal to view contracts, invoices, messages, files — everything in one place.

**Atlas today:** No external-facing portal. Everything is internal team-only. Sign app has public signing links, but no unified client experience.

**Opportunity:** A lightweight **client portal** where external contacts can log in and see their invoices, signed documents, shared files, and project status. Reuses existing data from CRM + Sign + Drive + Projects.

**Relevance: 4/5** — Very valuable for service businesses under 20 people. Reduces back-and-forth emails. Could be a strong differentiator.

---

### Gap 3: Proposals / Quotes (Combined Document)
**HoneyBook:** "Smart Files" combine proposal + contract + invoice into a single interactive document that clients can review, sign, and pay — all in one flow.

**Atlas today:** Sign app handles e-signatures on uploaded PDFs. Write app creates documents. But there's no way to create a structured proposal with line items, pricing, terms, and an accept/sign/pay flow.

**Opportunity:** A **Proposals** feature (within CRM or as its own section) that generates a branded proposal from a deal's data — scope, line items, pricing, terms — with an "accept & sign" flow that links to Sign and optionally generates an invoice.

**Relevance: 4/5** — Teams with 5-20 people often send proposals/quotes. This bridges CRM deals → contracts → invoices into a single workflow.

---

### Gap 4: Workflow Automation (Trigger-Based)
**HoneyBook:** Automation workflows that fire on events — e.g., "when a lead form is submitted, send welcome email + create project + assign questionnaire." Multi-step, visual builder.

**Atlas today:** `crmWorkflows` table exists and there's an `automations-view.tsx` component, suggesting early work. But no evidence of a robust automation engine with triggers, conditions, and actions across apps.

**Opportunity:** Enhance the existing workflow foundation into a real automation system: **"When [trigger] → Then [action]"** across CRM events (deal stage change, lead created, activity due) and potentially cross-app (create task, send email, create invoice).

**Relevance: 4/5** — Huge time-saver for small teams. Even simple automations (email on deal stage change, reminder on overdue activity) add massive value.

---

### Gap 5: Scheduling / Booking Links
**HoneyBook:** Built-in scheduling with shareable booking links, calendar sync (Google/iCloud), auto-generated Zoom links, availability management, double-booking prevention.

**Atlas today:** Calendar app exists but only has a manifest — appears to be a stub with no page or features. CRM has `schedule-event-modal.tsx` and event routes tied to contacts/deals, plus Google calendar sync. But no public booking links or availability management.

**Opportunity:** Build out the **Calendar app** with: (1) internal team calendar synced to Google, (2) shareable booking links that external contacts can use to schedule meetings, (3) availability rules per team member.

**Relevance: 3/5** — Useful but not critical for the 5-20 employee segment. Many already use Calendly/Cal.com. Could be a nice-to-have that reduces tool count.

---

### Gap 6: Questionnaires / Intake Forms
**HoneyBook:** Customizable questionnaires sent to clients for onboarding — collect project requirements, preferences, deadlines, file uploads.

**Atlas today:** Lead forms exist for lead capture, but no post-sale questionnaire/intake form system.

**Opportunity:** A **Forms** feature (extending lead forms) that can be sent to existing contacts/clients to collect structured information. Responses attach to the CRM contact/deal record.

**Relevance: 3/5** — Nice for service businesses doing client onboarding. Less critical than invoicing or proposals but adds polish.

---

### Gap 7: Branded Templates System
**HoneyBook:** All client-facing documents (invoices, proposals, contracts, emails) use branded templates with company logo, colors, and fonts. Template library with categories.

**Atlas today:** No unified branding/template system across apps. Each app handles its own presentation.

**Opportunity:** A **company branding** settings panel (logo, colors, fonts) that feeds into all client-facing outputs — invoices, proposals, email templates, sign documents, client portal.

**Relevance: 3/5** — Professional polish. Small companies care about looking "put together." Low effort, high perception of quality.

---

### Gap 8: Email Templates & Sequences
**HoneyBook:** Pre-built email templates for common scenarios (follow-up, thank you, onboarding). Customizable with smart fields (client name, project details).

**Atlas today:** CRM has `compose-email-modal.tsx` and email sending routes, but no template library or smart field system.

**Opportunity:** Add an **email template** system to CRM: save reusable templates with merge fields (contact name, deal value, company), use them when composing emails from contact/deal pages.

**Relevance: 3/5** — Reduces repetitive email writing. Works well with the existing CRM email infrastructure.

## Priority Ranking (Recommended Implementation Order)

| Priority | Feature | Why |
|----------|---------|-----|
| **P1** | Invoicing & Payments | Table-stakes for any business platform. Schema already partially exists. |
| **P2** | Proposals / Quotes | Natural bridge between CRM deals and invoicing. High-value workflow. |
| **P3** | Workflow Automation | Foundation already exists (`crmWorkflows`). Multiplies value of all other features. |
| **P4** | Client Portal | Differentiator. Ties together invoices + sign + files into external experience. |
| **P5** | Email Templates | Quick win. Enhances existing CRM email functionality. |
| **P6** | Company Branding | Low effort, professional polish across all client-facing features. |
| **P7** | Scheduling / Booking Links | Calendar app stub exists. Useful but many free alternatives exist. |
| **P8** | Questionnaires / Intake Forms | Nice-to-have. Extends existing lead forms system. |
