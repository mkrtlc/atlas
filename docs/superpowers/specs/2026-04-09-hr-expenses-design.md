# HR Expenses — Design Spec

**Date:** 2026-04-09
**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Overview

Add expense management to the HR app as a new sidebar section. Employees submit expenses for approval, managers approve/refuse, admins process payments. Expenses can optionally be grouped into reports and linked to projects.

Follows similar patterns to the existing leave management system (status machine with dedicated action endpoints, auto-assigned approver via `employees.managerId`, pending approvals queue with badge count, card-based approve/refuse UI) with these intentional differences:

- **Status names:** Expenses use `submitted` / `refused` (not `pending` / `rejected` as in leave). This reflects the different lifecycle semantics — a submitted expense can be recalled; a refused expense returns to draft for correction.
- **Email notifications:** This is the first HR feature to send email. Uses the global `sendEmail` service from `packages/server/src/services/email.service.ts` (already used by CRM/Sign). This is net-new wiring for the HR module.
- **StatusTimeline limitation:** The shared `StatusTimeline` component is linear-only. For expense detail, use it for the happy path (Draft → Submitted → Approved → Paid) and show refused status separately as a callout/badge, not as a timeline step.

---

## 2. Workflow & Statuses

```
Draft → Submitted → Approved → Paid
  ↑         ↓           ↓
  └── Refused ←── Refused
```

| Status | Who sets it | What happens |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| `draft` | Employee (create) | Expense is editable. Not visible to manager. |
| `submitted` | Employee (submit action) | Sent to manager. Employee can recall to Draft. Policy violations flagged. |
| `approved` | Manager (approve action) | Manager accepted. Ready for finance to process. |
| `refused` | Manager (refuse action) | Rejected with comment. Returns to Draft for employee to fix and resubmit. |
| `paid` | Admin (mark paid action) | Reimbursement processed. Terminal state. Bulk action supported. |

**Approver assignment:** Auto-set to `employees.managerId` on submit (same as leave). The `/expenses/pending` endpoint returns expenses where `approverId` matches the current user's employee record.

**Manager detection:** A user is a "manager" if any employee has them as `managerId`. The "Expense approvals" sidebar item is visible when `pendingCount > 0` OR when the user's HR app permission role is `admin`. This matches how leave approvals work — there is no separate "manager" role.

**Admin detection:** Uses `useMyAppPermission('hr')` — role `admin` sees All expenses, Categories, and Policies sidebar items. Role `editor` or `viewer` sees only My expenses and Expense reports.

**Expense reports:** When expenses are grouped into a report, the report has its own status. Submitting the report submits all its draft expenses. Approving the report approves all. Individual expenses within a report cannot be approved/refused separately — the report is the unit of approval.

## 3. Schema

### 3.1 `hr_expense_categories`

Admin-managed expense categories.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `id` | uuid | PK, defaultRandom |
| `tenantId` | uuid | FK → tenants, NOT NULL |
| `name` | varchar(255) | NOT NULL |
| `icon` | varchar(50) | NOT NULL, default `'receipt'` |
| `color` | varchar(20) | NOT NULL, default `'#6b7280'` |
| `maxAmount` | real | nullable — per-expense limit |
| `receiptRequired` | boolean | NOT NULL, default false |
| `isActive` | boolean | NOT NULL, default true |
| `sortOrder` | integer | NOT NULL, default 0 |
| `createdAt` | timestamp | NOT NULL, defaultNow |

Default categories seeded on first use: Travel, Accommodation, Meals, Transportation, Office Supplies, Software, Client Entertainment, Training, Phone/Internet, Miscellaneous.

### 3.2 `hr_expense_policies`

Spending limit rules.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `id` | uuid | PK, defaultRandom |
| `tenantId` | uuid | FK → tenants, NOT NULL |
| `name` | varchar(255) | NOT NULL |
| `monthlyLimit` | real | nullable — total monthly budget per employee |
| `requireReceiptAbove` | real | nullable — receipt required above this amount |
| `autoApproveBelow` | real | nullable — auto-approve under this amount |
| `isActive` | boolean | NOT NULL, default true |
| `createdAt` | timestamp | NOT NULL, defaultNow |
| `updatedAt` | timestamp | NOT NULL, defaultNow |

### 3.3 `hr_expense_policy_assignments`

Links policies to employees or departments.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `id` | uuid | PK, defaultRandom |
| `tenantId` | uuid | FK → tenants, NOT NULL |
| `policyId` | uuid | FK → hr_expense_policies, NOT NULL, cascade |
| `employeeId` | uuid | nullable FK → employees, cascade |
| `departmentId` | uuid | nullable FK → departments, cascade |
| `createdAt` | timestamp | NOT NULL, defaultNow |

One of `employeeId` or `departmentId` must be set. Employee-level assignment takes precedence over department-level.

### 3.4 `hr_expense_reports`

Optional grouping of expenses.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `id` | uuid | PK, defaultRandom |
| `tenantId` | uuid | FK → tenants, NOT NULL |
| `userId` | uuid | NOT NULL (creator's user ID, no FK — matches HR pattern) |
| `employeeId` | uuid | FK → employees, NOT NULL |
| `title` | varchar(500) | NOT NULL |
| `status` | varchar(20) | NOT NULL, default `'draft'` |
| `totalAmount` | real | NOT NULL, default 0 (computed on submit) |
| `currency` | varchar(10) | NOT NULL, default `'USD'` |
| `submittedAt` | timestamp | nullable |
| `approvedAt` | timestamp | nullable |
| `refusedAt` | timestamp | nullable |
| `paidAt` | timestamp | nullable |
| `approverId` | uuid | nullable |
| `approverComment` | text | nullable |
| `isArchived` | boolean | NOT NULL, default false |
| `createdAt` | timestamp | NOT NULL, defaultNow |
| `updatedAt` | timestamp | NOT NULL, defaultNow |

Note: `userId` has no FK constraint, matching the pattern used by `hr_leave_applications` and other HR tables where `userId` stores the acting user but doesn't enforce a FK to the `users` table.

### 3.5 `hr_expenses`

Individual expense records.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `id` | uuid | PK, defaultRandom |
| `tenantId` | uuid | FK → tenants, NOT NULL |
| `userId` | uuid | NOT NULL (no FK, matches HR pattern) |
| `employeeId` | uuid | FK → employees, NOT NULL |
| `categoryId` | uuid | FK → hr_expense_categories, set null on delete |
| `projectId` | uuid | nullable FK → projectProjects, set null on delete |
| `reportId` | uuid | nullable FK → hr_expense_reports, set null on delete |
| `description` | text | NOT NULL |
| `notes` | text | nullable |
| `amount` | real | NOT NULL |
| `taxAmount` | real | NOT NULL, default 0 |
| `currency` | varchar(10) | NOT NULL, default `'USD'` |
| `quantity` | real | NOT NULL, default 1 |
| `expenseDate` | timestamp | NOT NULL |
| `merchantName` | varchar(255) | nullable |

| `receiptPath` | text | nullable — file path from global `/api/upload` endpoint |
| `status` | varchar(20) | NOT NULL, default `'draft'` |
| `submittedAt` | timestamp | nullable |
| `approvedAt` | timestamp | nullable |
| `refusedAt` | timestamp | nullable |
| `paidAt` | timestamp | nullable |
| `approverId` | uuid | nullable |
| `approverComment` | text | nullable (refusal reason) |
| `policyViolation` | text | nullable — auto-set on submit if policy violated |
| `isArchived` | boolean | NOT NULL, default false |
| `createdAt` | timestamp | NOT NULL, defaultNow |
| `updatedAt` | timestamp | NOT NULL, defaultNow |

Indexes: `tenantId`, `employeeId`, `categoryId`, `status`, `reportId`, `projectId`, `expenseDate`.

## 4. Receipt Upload

Receipts use the existing global upload endpoint at `POST /api/upload` (multer, disk storage, `/uploads/` directory, 25 MB limit). The expense form uploads the file first via this global route, receives the file path in the response, then stores the path in `hr_expenses.receiptPath`.

No HR-specific upload route is needed. The `POST /expenses/:id/upload-receipt` route from the initial design is **removed** — use the global upload instead.

Updated API routes in section 5 reflect this removal.

## 6. HR Sidebar Additions

New "Expenses" section in the HR sidebar, placed after the "Leave" section.

The sidebar already has 13+ items. To manage this, the Expenses section should be **collapsible** (same as how the "Leave" section groups its items under a `SidebarSection` with a label). Admin-only items are only rendered when `appPermission.role === 'admin'`.

| Item | Icon | Visible to | Badge |
|------|------|------------|-------|
| My expenses | `Receipt` | All employees | — |
| Expense approvals | `ClipboardCheck` | Users with pending items OR admins | Pending count |
| All expenses | `LayoutList` | Admin only (`appPermission.role === 'admin'`) | — |
| Expense reports | `FolderOpen` | All employees | — |
| Expense categories | `Tag` | Admin only | — |
| Expense policies | `Shield` | Admin only | — |

**Portal views:** Add `my-expenses` and `expense-reports` to the `PORTAL_VIEWS` set so employees using the portal sidebar can access their expenses.

**NavSection type:** Add all 6 new view names to the `NavSection` union type in `page.tsx`.

---

## 7. Employee Views

### 7.1 My Expenses

DataTable with columns: date, category (icon + name), description, amount (formatted), project name, status badge. Client-side search. Filter tabs by status (All, Draft, Submitted, Approved, Refused, Paid).

"New expense" button opens the expense form modal.

### 7.2 Expense Form (modal)

Fields:
- **Category** — select from active `hr_expense_categories`
- **Expense date** — date picker
- **Description** — text input (required)
- **Merchant** — text input (optional)
- **Amount** — number input (required)
- **Tax** — number input (default 0)
- **Quantity** — number input (default 1)
- **Currency** — select with common options (USD, EUR, GBP, TRY), default `'USD'`
- **Payment method** — select: Personal card, Company card, Cash
- **Project** — optional select from `projectProjects`
- **Receipt** — file upload via global `/api/upload`, stores returned path
- **Add to report** — optional select/create a report
- **Notes** — textarea (optional)

Footer: **Save** (draft) / **Submit** (saves + submits)

Policy violations shown inline: if category has `maxAmount` and entered amount exceeds, show warning "Exceeds category limit of {amount}". If policy `requireReceiptAbove` and no receipt attached, block submit with error.

### 7.3 Expense Reports

List of reports with title, status badge, total amount, expense count, date range.

"Create report" modal: title input. After creation, user can add existing draft expenses to the report or create new ones within it.

Report detail: shows grouped expenses as a list, with total. Submit button submits the entire report.

---

## 8. Admin/Manager Views

### 8.1 Expense Approvals

Follows the leave approvals UI pattern (card list in `approvals-view.tsx`).

Card list showing: employee avatar + name, category icon + name, description, amount (large), expense date, merchant, policy violation warning badge (if `policyViolation` is set), receipt thumbnail (clickable to view full image).

Actions: **Approve** (green primary button) / **Refuse** (red, expands inline comment textarea).

Auto-approve: if policy `autoApproveBelow` is set and expense amount is under the threshold, the expense skips the approvals queue and goes directly to `approved`.

### 8.2 All Expenses

Org-wide DataTable: employee name, date, category, description, amount, project, status. Filters by status, employee, category, date range.

**Bulk "Mark as paid"**: checkbox column, bulk action button for approved expenses. Sets status to `paid`, `paidAt` to now, sends email notification.

### 8.3 Expense Categories

CRUD list: name, icon preview, color swatch, max amount, receipt required toggle, active toggle. Add/edit inline or via modal.

Seed button: "Add default categories" — creates the 10 standard categories if none exist.

### 8.4 Expense Policies

CRUD list: policy name, monthly limit, receipt threshold, auto-approve threshold, active toggle.

Policy detail: shows assignments (employees and departments). "Assign" button opens a picker to add employees or departments.

---

## 9. HR Dashboard — Expenses Section

Added to the existing HR Dashboard view as a new section:

### Summary Cards (top row)
- **Total expenses** this month (with % change vs last month)
- **Pending approvals** count
- **Unpaid amount** (approved but not yet paid)
- **Reimbursed** this month total

### Charts
- **Spend by category** — horizontal bar chart, top 5 categories by amount
- **Monthly trend** — line/bar chart, last 6 months of total spend

### Lists
- **Top spenders** — top 5 employees by total this month (avatar, name, amount)
- **Policy violations** — count of violations, top reasons (category, description)
- **Pending payments** — compact list of approved expenses awaiting payment (employee, amount, date)

---

## 10. Email Notifications

Uses the global email service at `packages/server/src/services/email.service.ts`. This is the first time the HR module sends email — import `sendEmail` directly. Sends only if SMTP is configured (the service handles this check internally).

| Event | Recipient | Subject |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Expense submitted | Manager (approver) | "New expense to review from {employeeName}" |
| Expense approved | Employee | "Your expense '{description}' was approved" |
| Expense refused | Employee | "Your expense '{description}' was refused" |
| Expense paid | Employee | "Your expense reimbursement of {amount} has been processed" |
| Report submitted | Manager (approver) | "Expense report '{title}' to review from {employeeName}" |
| Report approved | Employee | "Your expense report '{title}' was approved" |
| Report refused | Employee | "Your expense report '{title}' was refused" |

Email body should include: expense/report details, amount, and a link to the HR app (`{CLIENT_PUBLIC_URL}/hr`).

---

## 11. Policy Enforcement

When an employee submits an expense (or a report):

1. **Find applicable policy**: check `hr_expense_policy_assignments` for the employee's ID first, then their department ID. Employee-level takes precedence.

2. **Category limit check**: if `hr_expense_categories.maxAmount` is set and `expense.amount > maxAmount`, set `policyViolation = "Exceeds {category} limit of {maxAmount}"`. Allow submit but flag.

3. **Receipt requirement**: if policy `requireReceiptAbove` is set and `expense.amount > requireReceiptAbove` and `receiptPath` is null, **block submit** with error "Receipt required for expenses over {amount}".

4. **Auto-approve**: if policy `autoApproveBelow` is set and `expense.amount < autoApproveBelow`, auto-set status to `approved`, skip manager queue. Still send approval email to employee.

5. **Monthly limit check**: if policy `monthlyLimit` is set, sum all non-draft expenses for the employee this month. If adding this expense would exceed the limit, set `policyViolation = "Monthly limit of {monthlyLimit} exceeded"`. Allow submit but flag.

Policy violations are informational flags for the approver, NOT blockers (except missing receipt). The approver sees the violation and decides whether to approve anyway.

---

## 12. Status Display in Detail Panel

The shared `StatusTimeline` component renders a linear progression. Since expenses have a branching status (refused loops back to draft), handle it as follows:

**Happy path (status is not `refused`):** Show `StatusTimeline` with steps: Draft → Submitted → Approved → Paid. Set `currentIndex` based on current status (draft=0, submitted=1, approved=2, paid=3).

**Refused state:** Show a red callout/alert above the timeline: "Refused by {approverName}: {approverComment}". The timeline resets to show Draft as current (since the expense returns to draft for correction). Employee sees the refusal reason and can edit + resubmit.

---

## 13. Shared Components Reused

- **StatusTimeline** — for expense detail happy-path status progression
- **DataTable** — from existing HR components for list views
- **Badge** — for status badges
- **Modal** — compound Modal for expense form
- **FeatureEmptyState** — for empty state when no expenses
- **TotalsBlock** — from `components/shared/totals-block.tsx` for report totals display
