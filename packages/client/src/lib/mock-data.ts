I reviewed the roadmap draft. A few notes:

• The API redesign estimate seems optimistic — our last comparable project took 3 sprints, not 2
• Love the idea of the developer portal, but we should validate demand first with at least 5 customer interviews
• Can we add a buffer sprint between milestones? Q3 taught us we need breathing room

See you Thursday!

I've been working through our design token structure and I think we need to add a semantic layer. Right now we have primitive tokens (blue-500, gray-100, etc.) but no abstraction for intent.

Proposed semantic tokens:
  --color-action-primary → blue-500
  --color-action-primary-hover → blue-600
  --color-action-danger → red-500
  --color-surface-primary → white / gray-950
  --color-surface-elevated → white / gray-900

This way, themes become a matter of remapping semantic tokens to different primitives, and component styles never reference raw color values.

Thoughts?

One addition: we should include interactive state tokens too:
  --color-action-primary-pressed
  --color-action-primary-disabled

And for focus rings:
  --color-focus-ring → blue-400

I can start migrating the button and input components this week if we agree on the naming convention.

"Why Every Developer Should Understand Email Protocols"
by James Clear · 12 min read

IMAP, SMTP, and POP3 have been around for decades, yet most developers have never looked under the hood. This article breaks down the protocols that power 4 billion email accounts worldwide, and explains why understanding them can make you a better systems engineer.

Key takeaways:
• SMTP is a push protocol — it was designed in 1981 and still works
• IMAP maintains server-side state, POP3 doesn't
• Modern email is layers of hacks on top of RFC 822
• OAuth2 replaced passwords for good reason
